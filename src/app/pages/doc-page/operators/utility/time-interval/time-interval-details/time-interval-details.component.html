  Emits an object containing the current value, and the time that has passed between emitting the current value and the
  previous value, which is calculated by using the provided scheduler's now() method to retrieve the current time at
  each emission, then calculating the difference. The scheduler defaults to asyncScheduler, so by default, the interval
  will be in milliseconds.
