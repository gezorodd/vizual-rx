  One of the variants of Subjects is the <span class="code">BehaviorSubject</span>, which has a notion of "the current
  value". It stores the latest value emitted to its consumers, and whenever a new Observer subscribes, it will
  immediately receive the "current value" from the <span class="code">BehaviorSubject</span>.
