<p>pipe() can be called on one or more functions, each of which can take one argument ("UnaryFunction") and uses it to
  return a value. It returns a function that takes one argument, passes it to the first UnaryFunction, and then passes
  the result to the next one, passes that result to the next one, and so on.</p>
